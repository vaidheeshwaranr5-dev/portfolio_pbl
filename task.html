    <h1>ABOUT ME 👤 </h1>
    <P width="80%" class="one">
I am a passionate and dedicated Computer Science student with a strong interest in technology, programming, and web development. From a young age, I have been curious about how software and digital systems work, which inspired me to pursue a career in the field of computer science. My academic journey has provided me with a solid foundation in programming concepts, data structures, algorithms, and problem-solving techniques. I continuously strive to improve my technical knowledge and stay updated with emerging technologies.
Currently, I am pursuing my Bachelor’s degree in Computer Science, where I have developed practical experience through academic projects and hands-on programming tasks. I have worked with programming languages such as C, Python, and Java, which have strengthened my logical thinking and coding abilities. I enjoy solving computational problems and writing efficient, structured programs. Through lab work and mini-projects, I have gained confidence in developing applications that are both functional and user-friendly.
In addition to programming, I have a strong interest in web development and user interface design. I am skilled in HTML and CSS for building responsive and visually appealing web pages. I am also exploring JavaScript to enhance interactivity in web applications. Recently, I have started learning UI/UX design principles using tools like Figma to better understand how to create engaging and user-centered digital experiences. I believe that combining technical development skills with good design practices results in powerful and impactful applications.
Beyond technical skills, I value soft skills such as communication, teamwork, and time management. I have participated in group projects during my academic studies, where I collaborated effectively with team members to complete assignments successfully. These experiences have helped me improve my ability to share ideas clearly, listen to feedback, and work efficiently under deadlines. I consider myself a quick learner who adapts easily to new environments and challenges.
My long-term career goal is to become a skilled Full-Stack Developer and contribute to innovative software solutions that address real-world problems. I aspire to work in a dynamic organization where I can continue learning, take on new challenges, and grow both professionally and personally. I am particularly interested in developing applications that are not only technically strong but also accessible and user-friendly.

Apart from academics, I enjoy exploring new technologies, participating in coding practice sessions, and improving my problem-solving skills. I believe that consistent learning and practical experience are the keys to success in the technology field. With dedication, curiosity, and a strong work ethic, I am determined to build a successful career in software development and make meaningful contributions to the digital world<p><a href="#top">.</a></p>
